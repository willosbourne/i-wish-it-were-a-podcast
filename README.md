    # create-svelte

    Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

    ## Creating a project

    If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

    ```bash
    # create a new project in the current directory
    npm init svelte@next

    # create a new project in my-app
    npm init svelte@next my-app
    ```

    > Note: the `@next` is temporary

    ## Developing

    Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

    # or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
    npm run dev -- --open
    ```

    ## Building

    Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    > You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
